# üé¨ Personalized Movie Recommender

A content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on film metadata using machine learning and NLP techniques.

## üöÄ Overview

This project analyzes movie metadata (like genres, keywords, overview, etc.) to generate personalized movie recommendations. It uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to match user-selected movies with similar ones. The frontend is powered by Streamlit, and real-time movie posters are fetched using the TMDB API.

## üß† Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and merged metadata fields such as genres, keywords, and movie overviews.
- **Text Vectorization**: Applied TF-IDF using `scikit-learn` and performed NLP preprocessing with `NLTK`.
- **Similarity Matching**: Computed cosine similarity scores to recommend movies based on content features.
- **Streamlit App**: Developed an interactive Streamlit application for users to explore movie suggestions effortlessly.
- **API Integration**: Fetched real-time movie posters from the TMDB API for a dynamic user experience.
